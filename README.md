Welcome to StrikeOne, an application that makes it easier to keep a log and connect with players or coaches near you.
Lets say I am a Major League Scout and I go to games very often and meet lots of different coaches and players EVERY time I attend a game. 
Using the StrikeOne app, I would easily be able to keep a log of each player/coach that draws my interest and his data, without giving any of my personal information.
The Application allows users to enter his/her name, school, level, position, residence, contact info, and status so that I have all the information I need.
